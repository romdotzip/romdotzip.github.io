                    My name is Matt. I'm a student studying cyber and network security. I enjoy
                    solving puzzles, fixing problems, and creating new and fun things.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm making this website to keep all of my projects that I've worked on in
                    one spot. I also thought it would be good for me to practice keeping my
                    website secure from things like SQL injections (if I ever add a database), XSS, and
                    other web vulnerabilties.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Go take a look at my <a href="https://github.com/romdotzip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">github</a> to see
                    some more info about me, and any of my public projects.
